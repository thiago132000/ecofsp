The SoundCloud plugin for WordPress! Embed track, user latest tracks, or playlist!

== Description ==

NOTE: For WordPress 5.0.2 and above, you need to install the "Classic editor" to use this plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/) 
Otherwise, you can natively embed soundcloud tracks from the new editor.

This is a simple and easy to use plugin that allows you to embed audio from SoundCloud to your sidebar or directly inside your posts! All using a SoundCloud URL straight from the browser!

*   Single track
*   User Latest tracks
*   Playlist

All you need to do is provide the SoundCloud URL straight from your browser and the plugin will display the SoundCloud player! 

You can edit:

*   Height (width is responsive to fit all device screens).
*   Choose to auto play your audio track once page loads
*   Show/hide art work
*   Show/hide username

To update an existing SoundCloud track that you have embedded in your post, simply click on the SoundCloud track to select it (in "Visual" editor), then click the "Add SoundCloud" button again.

Enjoy!
